Eat That Burger!
'Eat That Burger' application demonstrates a full stack application having the front end with implemented HTML/CSS and the backend with Node.js and Express. HTML is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may select any burger name and add it to the menu. As it is added, it also updates the new burger selected into the MySQL database. The burger entry is added to the Burgers to Devour section on the top of the screen. The user may then eat any selected burger by clicking on it, moving it to Burgers Devoured, updating it's status as the database is updated.
